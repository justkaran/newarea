                    <p>We asked CodeDoor alumni to share their experiences and give tips to current learners. Here's what they told us:</p>
                    <h5>Casneil</h5>
                    <video width="640" height="360" controls>
                        <source src="static/video/casneil.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                    <p>&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <h5>Manal</h5>
                    <h6>What did you do before you qualified with CodeDoor?</h6>
                    <p>I was a system analyst in IMMPOWER maintenance management system (ERP System) at Shell Syria, then as a claim assistant in an insurance company in Qatar, and finally as a senior personal assistant to Chief Executive Officer at an insurance company in Qatar.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What did you do after you qualified with CodeDoor?
                    </h6>
                    <p>I was given access to the CodeDoor platform and received support from IT experts. Through this and the weekly team meetings it allowed me to get a broad range of knowledge and also support. CodeDoor inspired my Salesforce journey, providing me with the necessary information to enroll in ReDi school.
                    </p>
                    <h6>How could CodeDoor help you?
                    </h6>
                    <p>CodeDoor provided me with enough open doors to peruse, in order for me to recover my IT knowledge and to be prepared for the German market.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What do you want to accomplish next?
                    </h6>
                    <p>I took my first step as a Junior Salesforce Admin. Currently I have three certificates in Salesforce, preparing for more to come. My main goal is to hone my skills in Salesforce Ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What would you like to pass on to learners who are currently undergoing training?
                    </h6>
                    <p>Persistence and consistency is key. The hard work will be rewarded nicely. Never lose motivation. Never close a door.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Sara</h5>
                    <h6>How did you get together as a team?</h6>
                    <p>We didn't decide the group, it was suggested to us.

                    <h6>Why did your teamwork went well?</h6>
                    <p>That teamwork went ok, within the limitations of only being able to meet online due to the pandemic. I think we all were really motivated and eager to learn and to do it right.
                    </p>
                    <h6>How could CodeDoor help you so far?</h6>
                    <p>CodeDoor platform is really interesting and helpful to understand and follow a path guide. And our tutor was really helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you are so new in this learning process/ system, it takes a while to find the right way to make a better use of the resources offered (but that is also part of the learning process).
                    </p>
                    <h6>What do you want to accomplish next? Do you all have the same goals?</h6>
                    <p>My teammate and I decided to keep learning software engineering, so CodeDoor was a really good starting point to begin this new career. I really appreciate the opportunity to have access to the CodeDoor platform and community!
                    </p>
                    <h6>What would you like to pass on to learners who are currently undergoing training?</h6>
                    <p>I encourage new learners to ask as many questions as they have and don't hurry up, just enjoy each moment and make sure you understand everything before moving to a new subject.
                    </p>
